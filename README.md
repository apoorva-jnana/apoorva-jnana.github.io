# What is this about?

Hello, this is just a temporary space to document momentary rants that do not fit mobile phones. I mean, there is a lot to be said but not enough time to make it palatable for a "swipe" on the screen.
Hence, please enjoy the current rant which will be deleted at the next rant I'd like to make. Maybe by then, I'll have learnt a lot more and might be on the precipice of greater things or i may let this rust and this one single post will forever be here. Who knows what the future holds eh?
Alright, that's the README file.
Enjoy.
