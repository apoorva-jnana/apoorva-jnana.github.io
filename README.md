# What is this about?

Hello, I see you've stumbled on a little space on the internet I claim to be mine. Nothing grandiose, this is just a temporary space for exhaustive rants that do not fit mobile phones or the current attention spans. I mean, there is a lot to be said but not enough time to make it palatable for a "swipe" on the screen.
Hence, this is my small space to still get my opinions out there for anyone who bothered to click the link to know more.
EVerything posted here by its nature will be deleted at the next post. I will be maintaining an archive at my end that might be revisted when desired but the defaults are that this will be a single and static placeholder webpage with dynamic content in terms of well, my opinions. 
Alright, that's the README file.
Enjoy.
